To use, create a python2 virtualenv with the following command:
`virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python2.7 env/`

Then, activate the virtualenv with:
`source env/bin/activate`

Now install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Hopefully, this will help those confused soles who have yet to grasp the trie.
